TWITTER GROWTH HACKS - ALGORITHM-BASED STRATEGIES
===============================================

1. CONTACT SYNC BOOST
--------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Upload phone contacts to Twitter.
- Sync email contacts from Gmail/Outlook.
- Do this even if your account is old.
- Repeat every 30 days with fresh contacts.

WHY IT WORKS:
From STPFirstDegreeFetcher.scala:
  - ForwardPhoneBook -> 9.0 (Highest weight)
  - ReversePhoneBook -> 8.0
  - ForwardEmailBook -> 7.0
These signals are strongly weighted in Twitter's candidate generation, so syncing contacts boosts your placement in the recommendation graph.

2. ENGAGEMENT VELOCITY OPTIMIZATION
------------------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Post tweets at strategic times.
- Aim for 3–5 replies within the first 8 minutes.
- Target 7–10 retweets within the first hour.
- Use quote tweets to encourage further engagement.
- Space your tweets roughly 2.5 hours apart to avoid spam signals.

WHY IT WORKS:
From FeatureBasedScoringFunction.java:
  - Engagement features like retweetCount and favCount are used with a logarithmic (log2) scale.
  - Earlybird scoring applies a time decay (ageDecayMult) that heavily favors early engagement.
Boosted early engagement increases your tweet's score, making it more visible to followers.

3. PROFILE VIEW OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Pin a tweet that invites profile clicks (e.g., "Click my profile for part 2!").
- Cross-promote your profile URL on other platforms.
- Aim for at least 15 profile views per day and 3+ tweet clicks per post.

WHY IT WORKS:
From interaction_graph/README.md:
  Real Graph features include:
  - Profile views
  - Private engagements (tweet clicks)
These signals are key inputs in the machine learning model used in Real Graph, enhancing user interaction scores.

4. REPUTATION SCORE MANAGEMENT
------------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Ensure each tweet gains at least one engagement (reply, retweet, or like).
- Limit URLs to one per three tweets until your reputation improves.
- Avoid overusing hashtags (no more than 2 per tweet).
- Maintain a natural tweeting pace (fewer than 15 tweets per day).

WHY IT WORKS:
From SpamVectorScoringFunction.java:
  - The system requires a tweepcred threshold (around 25) or at least one engagement to avoid spam filtering.
Consistent engagement maintains your reputation and prevents your tweets from being flagged as spam.

5. NEW USER SIGNAL EMULATION
----------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Follow 5–7 accounts daily for 5 consecutive days.
- Engage with at least 3 tweets from each followed account.
- Focus your follows on a specific topic or community.
- Maintain consistent daily activity for at least 14 days.

WHY IT WORKS:
From PushTargetUserBuilder.scala:
  The logic checks for:
    - daysSinceSignup < 14
    - accounts flagged as "New"
By emulating new user behavior, your account may trigger recommendation prioritization (e.g., seed blending) even if it is older.

6. GEOGRAPHIC TREND TARGETING
-----------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Use Twitter Trends API to identify trending topics in your country.
- Include one trending hashtag in tweets during local peak hours (e.g., 7–9 AM or 6–8 PM).
- Engage with top tweets in these trending topics.
- Create localized content for events and holidays.

WHY IT WORKS:
From crowd_search_accounts/README.md:
  - The candidate source prioritizes the "most searched" accounts in a specific country.
Local engagement increases your visibility in region-specific recommendations.

7. MEDIA & VERIFICATION OPTIMIZATION
--------------------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Include native images or videos in at least 70% of your tweets.
- Tag or quote tweet verified accounts when relevant.
- Reply to verified accounts soon (within 5 minutes) after they tweet.
- Use Twitter's native media upload options instead of third-party links.

WHY IT WORKS:
From FeatureBasedScoringFunction.java:
  - If a tweet contains media (images or videos), the boosted score is multiplied by 1.2.
  - Interactions with verified accounts get an additional multiplier of 1.15.
These boosts directly increase tweet visibility in the ranking algorithm.

8. TOPIC & ENTITY OPTIMIZATION
-------------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Incorporate relevant trending keywords and localized hashtags.
- Ensure your tweets are enriched with topic-specific tags.
- When possible, reference current news or events within your niche.

WHY IT WORKS:
From EarlyBirdCandidateAdaptor.scala (via TopicsUtil):
  - The system uses tweetIdLocalizedEntityMap to annotate tweets with localized entities.
  - Tweets with topic annotations get extra credit if they satisfy device and topic settings.
This reinforces your tweet's relevance and visibility via topic-based candidate selection.

9. CONTENT DIVERSITY STRATEGY
-----------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Vary your tweet formats: mix plain text, images, videos, polls, and threads.
- Experiment with long threads and short bursts.
- Alternate content style to maintain audience interest and signal natural behavior.

WHY IT WORKS:
From FeatureBasedScoringFunction.java:
  - Boost factors are applied for media (hasImageUrl, hasVideoUrl).
  - Diverse content maximizes exposure across multiple candidate sources.
Multi-format tweets enhance your overall engagement metrics and feed into multiple scoring signals.

10. SYNCHRONIZED ENGAGEMENT BURST
---------------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Coordinate with a small group of trusted followers for a rapid engagement burst after posting.
- Schedule your tweets and prompt immediate likes, retweets, and replies in the first 5-10 minutes.
- Use social media groups or chat channels to synchronize this effort.

WHY IT WORKS:
From FeatureBasedScoringFunction.java and Real Graph:
  - Early retweet and fav counts (retweetCountPostLog2 & favCountPostLog2) greatly influence the scoring.
  - A concentrated burst of engagement leverages the age decay multiplier for a higher boosted score.
Quick, early engagements improve your ranking and subsequent visibility.

11. MUTUAL FOLLOW ENGAGEMENT
---------------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Actively engage with accounts that follow you back.
- Initiate conversations and reply frequently to build mutual relationships.
- Collaborate on threads or tweet series with like-minded peers.

WHY IT WORKS:
From STPFirstDegreeFetcher.scala:
  - The MutualFollowSTP algorithm weights mutual follows at a score of 10.0.
Strong tie signals from mutual engagement improve your connectivity in the recommendation graph.

ANTI-GAMING AWARENESS
---------------------
WHAT TO DO:
- Avoid excessive tweeting (limit to under 20 tweets per day).
- Maintain natural gaps (at least 2 hours between tweets).
- Vary your hashtags and tweet content.
- Do not engage in mass follow/unfollow behavior.

WHY IT WORKS:
From EarlybirdSearcher.java and SpamVectorScoringFunction.java:
  - AntiGamingFilters and spam detection mechanisms flag unnatural behavior.
Organic and gradual application of these strategies helps you avoid triggering these filters while boosting your algorithmic visibility.
